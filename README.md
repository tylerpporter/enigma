### Functionality: 4
> All functionality requirements are met. Crack method returns decrypted message without a key or a date. I don't understand the point in returning a key and/or date if a message can be decrypted without them. 
### OOP: 4
> Implemented both a module and inheritance in a logical manner. Code is more DRY because of proper organization between classes and modules.
### RCM: 4
> All methods are under 10 lines long. Methods and variable names are succinct. Appropriate enumerables are used.
### TDD: 4
> Every method is tested. Edge cases are tested. Stubs are used to test randomness. 100% test coverage
### VC: 3.5
> 50 + commits.  5 + pull requests. Almost all commits are singular functionality. PRs only include related logical chunks of functionality.
